# Restaurant order management system
 
This restaurant order management system is designed to help restaurant staff take customer orders, keep track of the orders, and manage the kitchen queue efficiently. The system uses a queue data structure to organize orders, ensuring that the kitchen staff can prioritize and process orders in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner. Orders can be placed, tracked, and marked as complete in the system.
